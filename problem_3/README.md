## How to run

The project is in the `main.ipynb` file. This is a Jupyter Notebook which holds markdown text explaining the environment and python code for showcasing the project with graphs, tables etc.
The algorithms can be run inside the `main.ipynb` file as it is. The parameters for adjusting the ACO can be done within `main.ipynb`, but please note that the parameters for adjusting the PSO must be done within `sia/pso.py` in the Vehicle class.

**NOTE**: To run the algorithms in the notebooks yourself, some libraries are required:

You can see them all in the `requirements.txt` file, and install them by `pip install -r requirements.txt`. [Please be inside a python environment]

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
