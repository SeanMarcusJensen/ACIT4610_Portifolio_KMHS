# Biweekly Documentation (Week 39 and 40) - Delivered to Teacher.

## What was accomplished?
- We have implemented algorithms requested in the portfolio:  
  Version 3: Basic Evolutionary Strategy  
  Version 4: Advanced Evolutionary Strategy  
  Version 5: (μ + λ) Evolutionary Strategies  
  Version 6: (μ, λ) Evolutionary Strategies  
- We have implemented Tournament selection
- We have implemented multiple fitness evaluator methods
- We have implemented multiple recombinator methods
- We have restructured the the code into object-oriented programming
- We have made visualizations for the algorithm-results
- We have downloaded 5 road segments for problem 1



## What group members have done
- Sean and Kristoffer
    - Implemented the algorithms for problem 2
    - Restructured the code for problem 2
 - Hanan
     - Downloaded datasets for problem 1



## What's going to happen?
- We would like to complete problem 2.
  - Implement the EP algorithms:  
    Version 1: Basic Evolutionary Programming  
    Version 2: Advanced Evolutionary Programming
  - Finalize the performance metrics and visualizations
  - Write the report for this specific problem.
- We want to proceed with problem 1.
  - Begin with the preprocessing of the data
  - Understand the problem and find constants for formulas required



## What should have been done better?
- We should have had more workshops
- Due to one team memeber not able to participate, we did not accomplish all the tasks set for the past two weeks



## Additional info
- We have lost one team member. He has not been able to participate in the group project for the past two weeks (He will sendt you a private email)
