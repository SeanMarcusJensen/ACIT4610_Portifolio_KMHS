## Standards to follow

### Python

For the code, we'll use the PEP 8 standard [https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/], one exclusion is that we're using tabs instead of spaces.

### Git Strategy

We follow (Gitflow)[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow] for structuring branches and such.

Whenever solving an 'Issue', create a new branch out from 'main', call it 'feature/{issue_id}-{some-good-title}', where the {issue_id} is the '#' in the Issue title, and the title is something meaningful.
Once the 'Issue' is done, and the feature branch is ready for merge, create a 'Pull Request' into main, and make sure someone approves the changes made.
