[SEAN]
Loaded data into pandas Data Frames for data discovery.
While doing the initial data analysis it was discovered that the data was inconsistant with the date ranges.

`
Traffic Data Time Range: 01/08/2012 - 12/13/2020
Segment Data Time Range: 09/24/2024 01:04:03 PM - 09/27/2024 12:59:09 AM
`

This is an issue because the traffic volume and the speed between segments is dependant on time. Which currently makes them incomparable.
